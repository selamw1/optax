"""Keeps the Markdown previews of the Jupyter notebooks in sync.

Notebook diffs are hard to review, so each notebook tracked by git has a
Markdown preview in `.github/notebook-reviews/` that mirrors its path, e.g.
`examples/lbfgs.ipynb` -> `.github/notebook-reviews/examples/lbfgs.md`.

This script runs as a pre-commit hook, locally and in CI. It
1. regenerates the preview of every tracked notebook,
2. deletes the previews of deleted or renamed notebooks,
3. fails if any preview was changed, deleted or is not tracked by git yet, so
   that notebook changes cannot be merged without their previews.
